This is a flutter project developed by Youssef Elyourizi

To consume the API i fetched the data from this json file : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json"

To do so i added the http package in pubspec.yaml file
then i made a network request by calling the method http.get() and finally i converted the http.response into 
a dart object and i displayed the data.
